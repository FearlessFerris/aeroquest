# Project Ideas 



# Aircraft API Application 


### What is the purpose of this idea? 


The purpose of this idea is to solve a simple problem... teach users about avation!
I think that avation is one of the most important industries that the vast majority of people just don't know enough 
about. My goal with the creation of this application is to demonstrate the incredible feats of engineering and rigor
that goes into maintaining and innovating in an industry as complex as is vital for the sustainability of life as we 
know it. 


### Where will I find the information?


The information will be found using the [ Avationstack API ]( https://aviationstack.com/ ) a website used for making requests to API endpoints 
and retrieving detailed information relating to: **airlines**, **aircraft**, **flights**, **general avation**, and even **historical flight** 
data. 


### How will this information be presented? 


When covering a topic so many people actually know little if anything about it is important the information be presented 
in a very easily digestible way. I intend to achieve this by the creation of a familiar feeling ***search engine***-esque application. 
My application will allow a user to create an account and retrieve information from an API based on an intuitive and comprehensive
search-menu as well as the ability to search for and save information to the user(s) personal account for later reference.   



### What are the must haves within this application? 

1.) Ability for a user(s) to sign up / create an account but also not hinder basic usage without an account 
2.) Must allow for database Normalization and ensure any user data / information is stored safely and securely
3.) Ensure ease of use is paramount and at the forefront of every design and aspect of the application



### What is the tech stack that will be used for this application? 

- React / Node.js 
- Express 
- Authentication ( JSON Web Tokens )
- PostgreSQL 


### Maybe Also

- Socket.IO 
- Redux
